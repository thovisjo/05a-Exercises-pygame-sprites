# 05a-Exercises-pygame-sprites

This is a series of exercises meant to help teach sprites and how to use them. The first exercise is just describing what some code does. The second involves making random blocks of color go in random directions. The third is the same as the second except with sprites and images. The fourth deals with randomly animating a sprite sheet.
